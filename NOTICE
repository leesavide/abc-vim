ABC standard Vim scripts
Copyright 2012 Lee Savide <leesavide@gmail.com>

This product includes software developed for the Vim text editor, and for
the ABC music notation standard.

Portions of this software were based on code from the ABNF description of
the ABC standard, written by Henrik Norbeck, found at
http://www.norbeck.nu/abc/bnf/abc20bnf.htm, or as a text file at
http://www.norbeck.nu/abc/bnf/abc20bnf.txt .

This software contains code derived from the ABC standard, version 2.1. The
standard is licensed under a Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. Please read the
license terms at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/, and if
you wish to, read the full license deed at
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/legalcode . Additionally,
the ABC standard now uses keywords that conform to RFC 2119, and as such,
the standard conforms to the following:

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119.

In addition to the key words above, the key word "VOLATILE" is used to
indicate sections which are under active discussion and/or likely to change
in some future version of the standard. Any comments used in the source
code of the Vim scripts included in this software also conform to the key
words as described above, and in RFC 2119.

Lastly, any documentation will also be under a license equal or compatible
