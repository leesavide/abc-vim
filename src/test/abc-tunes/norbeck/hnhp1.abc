This file contains 7 hornpipes (#101 - #107).
You can find more abc tune files at http://home.swipnet.se/hnorbeck/abc.htm
I've transcribed them as I have learnt them, which does not necessarily mean
that I play them that way nowadays. Many of the tunes include variations and
different versions. If there is a source (S:) or discography (D:) included the
version transcribed might still not be exactly as that source played the tune,
since I might have changed the tune around a bit when I learnt it.
The tunes were learnt from sessions, from friends or from recordings.
When I've included discography, it's often just a reference to what recordings
the tune appears on.
