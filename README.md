This project includes software developed by many developers, all in part to implement the abc music notation standard.

I created this project to try to make the standard a bit more formallized, and to provide a common place for the software that the standard relies on to be kept.

Please note that the Apache License, Version 2.0 contained here only applies to any of the Vim scripts I personally will be making. It does NOT apply to the other projects that OTHER DEVELOPERS have made, each of which were uploaded AS IS from the archives those developers provide. Each of them has their OWN licenses that applies to their projects, as well as any info needed for compiling/installing any software they are intended to make.
